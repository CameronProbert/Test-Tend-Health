# Test for Tend Health
## Comments
Not completed to the standard I'd like, and also had trouble with CORS so there is no data fetching going on, it is in the code but commented out.

## Where is my code?
All within
```
src/
   | App.tsx
   | App.css
   | DashboardItem.tsx
   | data.ts
   | Types.ts
```

The rest is pregenerated using Vite.

## Running the app
Use `$ npm run dev` to start the application
